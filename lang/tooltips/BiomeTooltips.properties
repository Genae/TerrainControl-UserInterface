biomeSize:<html># Biome size from 0 to GenerationDepth. Show in what zoom level biome will be generated (see GenerationDepth)<p># Higher numbers=Smaller% of world / Lower numbers=Bigger % of world<p># Don`t work on Ocean and River (frozen versions too) biomes until not added as normal biome.</html>
biomeRarity:<html># Biome rarity from 100 to 1. If this is normal or ice biome - chance for spawn this biome then others.<p># Example for normal biome :<p>#   100 rarity mean 1/6 chance than other ( with 6 default normal biomes).<p>#   50 rarity mean 1/11 chance than other<p># For isle biome this is chance to spawn isle in good place.<p># Don`t work on Ocean and River (frozen versions too) biomes until not added as normal biome.</html>
biomeColor:<html># Biome color in hex value. Biome color in /tc map command</html>
biomeRivers:<html># True if biome can pass rivers.</html>
isleInBiome:<html># Biome name list where this biome will be spawned as isle. Like Mushroom isle in Ocean.  This work only if this biome is in IsleBiomes in world config</html>
biomeIsBorder:<html># Biome name list where this biome will be border.Like Mushroom isle shore. Use is compared as IsleInBiome</html>
notBorderNear:<html># Biome name list near border is not applied. </html>
biomeTemperature:<html># Biome temperature. Float value from 0.0 to 1.0</html>
biomeWetness:<html># Biome wetness. Float value from 0.0 to 1.0</html>
replaceToBiomeName:<html># Replace this biome to specified after all generations. Warning this will cause saplings and mob spawning work as in specified biome</html>
biomeHeight:<html># BiomeHeight mean how much height will be added in terrain generation<p># It is double value from -10.0 to 10.0<p># Value 0.0 equivalent half of map height with all other default settings</html>
biomeVolatility:<html># Biome volatility.</html>
maxAverageHeight:<html># If this value is greater than 0, then it will affect how much, on average, the terrain will rise before leveling off when it begins to increase in elevation.<p># If the value is less than 0, then it will cause the terrain to either increase to a lower height before leveling out or decrease in height if the value is a large enough negative.</html>
maxAverageDepth:<html># If this value is greater than 0, then it will affect how much, on average, the terrain (usually at the ottom of the ocean) will fall before leveling off when it begins to decrease in elevation. <p># If the value is less than 0, then it will cause the terrain to either fall to a lesser depth before leveling out or increase in height if the value is a large enough negative.</html>
volatility1:<html># Another type of noise. This noise is independent from biomes. The larger the values the more chaotic/volatile landscape generation becomes.<p># Setting the values to negative will have the opposite effect and make landscape generation calmer/gentler.</html>
volatility2:<html># Another type of noise. This noise is independent from biomes. The larger the values the more chaotic/volatile landscape generation becomes.<p># Setting the values to negative will have the opposite effect and make landscape generation calmer/gentler.</html>
volatilityWeight1:<html># Adjust the weight of the corresponding volatility settings. This allows you to change how prevalent you want either of the volatility settings to be in the terrain.</html>
volatilityWeight2:<html># Adjust the weight of the corresponding volatility settings. This allows you to change how prevalent you want either of the volatility settings to be in the terrain.</html>
disableBiomeHeight:<html># Disable all noises except Volatility1 and Volatility2. Also disable default block chance from height.</html>
customHeightControl:<html># List of custom height factor, 17 double entries, each entire control of about 7 blocks height from down. Positive entry - better chance of spawn blocks, negative - smaller<p># Values which affect your configuration may be found only experimental. That may be very big, like ~3000.0 depends from height<p># Example:<p>#   CustomHeightControl:0.0,-2500.0,0.0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0<p># Make empty layer above bedrock layer.</html>
surfaceBlock:<html># Surface block id</html>
groundBlock:<html># Block id from stone to surface, like dirt in plain biome</html>
useWorldWaterLevel:<html># If disabled use water levels and blocks below for this biome</html>
waterLevelMax:<html># Set water level. Every empty block under this level will be fill water or another block from WaterBlock</html>
waterLevelMin:<html># Set water level. Every empty block under this level will be fill water or another block from WaterBlock</html>
waterBlock:<html># BlockId used as water in WaterLevel</html>
iceBlock:<html># BlockId used as ice</html>
replacedBlocks:<html># Replace Variable: BlockIdFrom=BlockIdTo[.BlockData][(minHeight-maxHeight)]<p># Example :<p>#   ReplacedBlocks:2=3(100-128),13=20<p># Replace grass block to dirt from 100 to 128 height and replace gravel to glass on all height</html>
